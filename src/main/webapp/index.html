        <div>
            A WebDAV browser / upload manager written in entirely in JavaScript. You can:<br/>
            <br/>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on folders to browse around</li>
                <li>Upload image files (please, keep it SFW!)</li>
                <li>Images will be resized, then uploaded in chunks</li>
                <li>Click on images to view them</li>
                <li>You can browse away and come back during upload, and the upload will resume</li>
                <li>You can select files with the checkbox and delete them</li>
            </ol>
            This site will be up until it gets abused or until I get bored with the concept. Have fun!<br/>
